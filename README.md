A portable C library for drawing shapes and handling keyboard events (for simple games).

This library has been designed for educational purpose (teaching C) but it is nevertheless efficient, easy to use, portable and useful.

In practice this library interfaces the Java Virtual Machine to use its graphical primitives.


## Building and testing in multiple languages (current status)

    ./apply-mapping.sh map-en-abstract
    ./apply-mapping.sh map-fr-fr


## The API in your language

This library is designed to target students of any country (originally, french students).
The library is written in abstract-english and the APIs in different languages are generated from it.
It is thus easy to make your own version of the library for your language.
